                <header>How it Works?</header>
                <p>Basically TextSpam uses the Android text messaging API to send messages using your existing cellular service.
                    Whenever you click "Send", the application submits the list of messages to the phone's internal queue of messages to send. This is why one must exercise extreme caution; once you send a request there is no way to stop it unless you turn off your phone or force close the app.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <p>Should a message fail to send (this happens quite often), TextSpam recovers the message and resends it to the queue so that it wont go unaccounted for.</p>

                <header>Why you should choose TextSpam?</header>
                <p>TextSpam is great because it gives you the ability to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use your own recognizable number.</li>
                    <li>Send out as many messages as you want.</li>
                    <li>Do all of this at no cost.</li>
                </ul>

                When I first launched the application, it had a completely differernt purpose in mind. As the years passed, I started to hear testimonials of small business owners thanking me. Turns out that TextSpam was also a great app to maintain mailing lists. And so began the unprecedented growth that blew away all of my expectations.

                    <br> <p>Most people don't use their texting plan to begin with, why not take advantage of the tremendous capabilities that you pay for anyways.</p>

                <div id="friendsspam"><p>Being honest, TextSpam is first and foremost an application to send out a single message to a small subset of users. Use the application and push your friends to their limits :P.</p><br><p>TextSpam can trace back it's origins to February 2013. At the time, me and my friends had started so called "texting wars" where we would spam each other with messages. At the time my friends had BlackBerries, meaning that they could send messages at a much faster rate than with my phone. This made me think, why not automate the process (Robots work more efficient than humans right :) ). Later that night, the first alpha of TextSpam was created and the texting wars ceased after textspam allowed me to exercise attrition warfare.</p></div><div id="friendsimagewrapper"><img id="friendsimage" src="../Images/friends.jpg"/></div>
