"description":"SecretSauce is a dropbox alternative, presenting shared files in way similar to reddit. The application centralized file sharing with a emphasis on privacy; there are no user accounts, no cookies, and no traces of a user having used the service. All for the sake of privacy. The application utilizes flask and can be run on practically any network connected system. (Created for SEHackDay 2014)"
