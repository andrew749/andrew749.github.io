So as the title implies, this is my first blog post.

Over the years, I've noticed that most of the times I encountered problems, I turned to blog posts to provide me with the insight needed to solve these problems.

Naturally, I figured it was due time to give back to the community in any way that
I could. And so kicked off my massive site rewrite which included planning for
this blog.

I will try to update this with relevant information that I find in my
development journey, in hopes that it might help others or help provide
a unique and alternative perspective on problem solving that others may find
useful.

Hopefully this will grow into something that I can be proud of!
